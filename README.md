## Introduction
The Commitment to Equity (CEQ) was designed to analyze the impact of taxation and social spending on inequality and poverty	in individual countries, and provide a roadmap for governments, multilateral institutions, and nongovernmental 		organizations in their efforts to build more equitable societies. Directed by Nora Lustig, the CEQ is a joint project of CIPR and the Department of Economics at Tulane University and the Inter-American Dialogue.

This [**india_ceq**](https://github.com/mynorvc/india_ceq) repository is a collection of files, tasks and project following of implementation of CEQ in India by [**Centre For Budget and Governance Accountability**](http://www.cbgaindia.org/)
